## Today's Task

Please help me find the TOP 5 best matching job positions for today, **UPDATE THIS DATE: [Today's Date]**.

### Requirements:
1. Search for NEW job postings (posted in last 7 days)

Priority on roles that value design thinking, data-driven decision making, and product strategy. I use AI-assisted development tools (Cursor, Claude) rather than traditional coding, so focus on roles where product thinking, design systems, data analysis, and AI-assisted development are valued over deep coding expertise. Also consider: **Senior Product Designer** roles with technical/design systems focus or **Product Engineer** roles at companies that embrace AI-assisted development.
5. Consider visa sponsorship requirements: **YES** (I need visa sponsorship)
