## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Frontend Only (Simplest)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-application-tracker.git
   cd job-application-tracker
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or use a local server (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8080
   ```

3. **Visit** `http://localhost:8080`

That's it! The app works without any backend. Job suggestions fetch real jobs from free public APIs (Remotive, Arbeitnow, GitHub Jobs).

### Option 2: With Job Crawler (Full Features)

To enable automatic job searching from multiple sources:

1. **Set up the crawler backend**
   ```bash
   cd crawler
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys (optional)
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open the frontend**
   - In a new terminal:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

3. **Visit** `http://localhost:8080`

The frontend will automatically connect to the crawler API on port 3000.
